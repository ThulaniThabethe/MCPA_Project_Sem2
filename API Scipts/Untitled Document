### Step 1: Backend Setup (XAMPP & PHP)
1.  **Project Location**: You saved and extracted your `register.php` file into your XAMPP's web server directory, which is typically `htdocs/`.

Where to Store Your PHP Scripts
You need to store your PHP scripts inside the web server's root directory. This is the folder that your web server (like XAMPP's Apache) uses to serve files.

For XAMPP on Linux: The root directory is typically /opt/lampp/htdocs/.

For XAMPP on Windows: The root directory is typically C:\xampp\htdocs\.

2.  **Database Connection**: You configured the PHP script to connect to your local MySQL database by setting the server, username (`root`), and a **blank password** (`""`).
3.  **Script Logic**: The script was written to receive user data, **hash the password for security**, and perform an `INSERT` query to store the user in the `users` table.

### Step 2: Frontend Setup (Android App)
1.  **Dependencies**: You added the **Volley** library dependency to your `app/build.gradle.kts` file to handle network requests.
2.  **Network Permissions**: You added the `INTERNET` permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
3.  **Cleartext Traffic**: To fix the `NoConnectionError`, you correctly allowed unencrypted HTTP connections by adding `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` to your `<application>` tag and **removed or modified** the `networkSecurityConfig` that was overriding it.

### Step 3: Local Network Communication
1.  **Finding IP Address**: You used `ifconfig` in your terminal to find your **local private IP address** (e.g., `192.168.0.188`), which the Android emulator needs to connect to your computer on the same local network.
2.  **URL Configuration**: You updated the URL in your `RegisterActivity.java` file to use this local IP address, pointing to the location of your PHP script.
